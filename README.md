# PYTHON_ROCK_PAPER_SCISSOR_GAME

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python

Description:
The Rock, Paper, Scissors Game project is a simple implementation of the classic game where the player chooses between rock, paper, or scissors, and competes against the computer's choice. The game is implemented using Python programming language. The player and computer choices are randomly generated, and the winner is determined based on the game's rules.

Objectives:

1. Implement a rock, paper, scissors game using Python.
2. Generate random choices for both the player and the computer.
3. Determine the winner based on the game's rules.
4. Provide an interactive experience for the player to play multiple rounds of the game.

Tools Used:
Jupyter Notebook: for interactive development and documentation of the code.
Visual Studio Code (VSCode): for writing and editing the Python code.

Outcome:
The project provides a fun and interactive way to practice Python programming skills while implementing a classic game. By running the code in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode, users can play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game and enjoy the challenge of competing against the computer. The project serves as a practical exercise for beginners to learn basic Python syntax and logic while creating an entertaining game.
